# DeSeq2_DEGs_OutlierDetector
A post-hoc analysis tool that identifies differentially expressed genes (DEGs) whose statistical significance may be driven by single-sample outliers rather than consistent biological differences. This approach helps distinguish between technical artifacts and legitimate biological variation in RNA-seq differential expression results.
